# Project 6 - Effect of State-Level Social Distancing Measures Implemented by the United States of America on Air Pollution Levels

This study examined the association between COVID-19 induced social distancing measures implemented at the state-level in the USA with levels of air pollution accounted for as PM 2.5 concentration. Air pollution data (PM 2.5) and social distancing dates were obtained for NY, CA, MA, IL, WA, and WI from January 2018 to March 2020. Additionally, population compliance with government mandated lockdowns was explored using satellite imagery from before and after COVID-19 induced lockdowns for three major US cities.
